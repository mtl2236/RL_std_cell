# RL_std_cell

This program is an reforcement learning program to train an agent that can automaticly generate valid flexible standard cells based on a compact model(Athor:Leilai Shao). First of all, the generated standard cell must have normal logic function. Besides, the PDP(Power Delay Product) is another optimization target which lower is better.

The structure of this whole program is the same as AutoCkt. The reward is extracted from .lib file generated by Cadence Liberate. Due to License constraint, we can temporarily run 5 simulation threads parallelly.
